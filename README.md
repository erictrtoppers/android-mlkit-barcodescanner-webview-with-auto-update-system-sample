# android-mlkit-barcodescanner-webview-with-auto-update-system-sample
Android webview application that allows hooking into Android barcode scanning capabilities and sending info back and forth between webviews.

Auto update feature works when the app is installed manually.  Debugging via Android Studio will say there's a conflicting app, but it works when released normally.
